Guide to reproduce experiments:

0) Use fffc_tiny model trained for '3_compression' to make these experiments

1) Compress each model with compression.py in '3_compression' with
   different configurations of hyperparameters

2) Copy folder 'cores_fffc_tiny' in '3_compression' to '2_hyperparameters'
